# Overview of the PARA system
This workflow is designed around discrete units of work called projects and utilizes Tiago Forte's PARA system of file structure and organization. The PARA system (Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive) is an excellent place to start for organizing your files - if you don't have strong feelings about how your work files are organized on your computer, I *highly* suggest starting with this. If you do have strong feelings, you can always adapt the system to something that works for you. Utilizing this system doesn't necessarily commit you to going back and re-organizing all of your work files on your computer. Just start now, and build as you go and work on new projects. As you have time in the future, you can always go back and fit your previous work into this structure. *However - see my notes on things to watch for when you go back to "refactor" your files and folder structure.* 

The most important thing is to **start now; start today**.

The second most important thing is to use the same structure *across apps, platforms, and languages*, which will allow deep integration and ensure you always know where everything is. You will spend less time trying to find for example, a small test R script you wrote last year or that interesting thing you read 18 months (or 2 months!) ago that was related to this project.

## The PARA system in practice
Tiago Forte's PARA acronym stands for: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive. This system is not strictly hierarchical, but each category from front to back in PARA is given precedence over the last. That is because the underlying philosophy is that projects should produce end outputs or deliverables. Things that are not yet projects, or are larger than a single project are more nebulous, **but not any less valuable**.

Using the PARA system requires you to set up high level folders (I would suggest in the Documents directory of your computer) for each of the PARA categories: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive. Then, all of your professional work, and eventually some of your personal work and interests will nest under these.

Defining projects is probably the most important part of this workflow and drives everything else, so I will start there.

## Projects vs Areas vs Resources vs Archive
Work through from Projects to Archive - dichotomous key - if it doesnt fit in the others, its an archive

## What is a project? How should I name my projects?
### Defining Projects - How to Determine if Something is a Project
This seems like a trivial question but defining project boundaries in research can be difficult. Where does one project end and another begin? Does a project include multiple sub projects?

**A project is something you are involved in that has a discrete, definable end state or product**. Note that our definition of projects here means they are **flat**. There should not be multiple projects nested under other projects. Each project is a discrete entity - this alings with GitHub repository organization (as we will see in future chapters), which allows **deep integration**. In our line of work, examples would be:	

- A thesis **chapter**; see below for why a thesis or dissertation itself is actually larger than a Project - it is an Area

- A manuscript

- A grant *might* be a project, but is usually better defined as an Area (because these days all grants are collaborative) with multiple projects underneath. Also, because most grants actually have multiple end products such as reports and manuscripts.

- Reports to stakeholders on unpublished data.

- X Are conference presentations nested in here? No - they are not projects but nested under projects.

- X Photos are nested and linked to projects in the GitHub readme file

### Naming Projects
This is a general style guide for naming projects (in the context of files or folder structures). Projects may have very long actual names (or you may not even know what, exactly the name of your project or project idea will eventually be). This doesn't matter for the purposes of project setup. For now, we just need a two to three word abbreviated title for the project that we will use in our folder structure. For example, I am working on a manuscript called "Techniques for Field Identification of the Permafrost Table" - but the three words in the project name in my folder structure are: permafrost, table, ID. Here is a style guide for naming your projects:

1. Project names should start with your initials

2. Projects should be designated as M (for manuscript, including thesis chapters, which should each be a publishable unit), P (for proposal), or R (for report) depending on the type of the end output.

3. Projects should be given a two digit number (with a leading zero for any project numbers under 10) - these are just given in sequence as you create projects - so your first project is 01 - *the order doesn't matter*.

4. Projects should have a unique two to three word abbreviated name that is different from other projects you are working on.

Your final project name is a combination of these four components as follows. Lets say I wanted to create a project structure for the "Techniques for Field Identification of the Permafrost Table" manuscript I am working on, and lets say it is the 9th project in my directory. 

My project name is then Initials-TypeNumber-Word1-Word2-Word3. So, the project name for my manuscript would be:

**NAJ-M09-permafrost-table-ID**

## What is an Area? How should I name my Areas?
### Defining Areas - How to Determine if Something is an Area
Areas are larger and more nebulous to define than projects, and they are also recurring and don't necessarily have an endpoint (although they might have milestones or deliverables nested within them). The following are examples of Areas:

- Teaching a course.
- Grants. Although grants do have a definable end state, they should still be areas because they are highly collaborative and typically have multiple projects under them.
- Annual reviews or summaries
- X Other examples?

### Naming Areas
Area names can be a bit more general than project names. They should still be numbered
