    "section": "",
    "text": "This book outlines an open, standardized workflow for use on all projects in the Jelinski lab. With the diverse library of tools, apps, and digital repositories available to you as a researcher, at times, it is extremely difficult to understand which ones to use and how to put together a coherent workflow that promotes the FAIR (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and FAIRER (Findable, Accesible, Interoperable, Reusable, Ethical, and Reproducible) open science principles in your work. My goal is to standardize workflow for all projects in our lab - or at the very least to provide a scaffolded, foundational approach that everyone can borrow and modify from as best fits their needs. This is not so much meant to force you into a particular way of doing your thinking things, but rather to free you up to do what’s really important, the research. Making decisions about how to name files, what format and style to use for code, how to structure project files and folders, and what tools and apps to use is exhausting, and these decisions take you away from the science. The goal of this standardized workflow is to produce open science that is easily reproducible, transparent, usable by others, and most importantly well organized and documented so that you and others can easily understand what you’ve done and how you’ve done it. There are a few principal concepts behind this workflow and how you can structure your work to be most productive:\n\n\nA major part of research is hitting dead ends, going down rabbit holes, and generally feeling like you might be wasting your time because it’s taking you so long to get to the correct analysis or perspective. However, none of this is waste of time. Every dead end is a door that has closed to allow you to find your path forward. It’s your job as a scientist and researcher to define and document those dead ends and not give up. Recognize that those dead ends are part of the process, and make those dead ends work for you. By using a standardized workflow even those dead ends become reproducible transparent learning experiences that are documented fully for you and others to grow from.\n\n\n\nOne of my mentors as probationary faculty, Dr. Ed Nater, told me that a career in science “is a marathon, not a sprint”. Despite the modern urgency to publish as many papers as possible in a short amount of time, research still takes time. And often we don’t know exactly how long it is gonna take. It’s better to do good science then to do fast science. Of course ideally we would do good, fast science. This workflow will help you do that - it will help you do good science, create transparent, citeable and reproducible content, even from your unfinished drafts, dead ends, and false starts.\nAdditionally, because research is a marathon and not a sprint, it is absolutely important that you take care of your whole being. This means taking care of your body and your mind. Let me tell you a story.\nAs an academic, most of us who are in this for the career work long hours. I’ve been working long hours and overnights for as long as I can remember - this is normal in academia. I used to view this as “the grind”. I used to think that the answer to be more productive was just putting in more hours in the grind. If I could just stay up one more night, push through for three more hours, sit at my desk for 10-12 hours in a day, and work work work, I could produce more. What I realized as I’ve reached the middle of my career is that there are better ways to produce more which also allow you to be healthier than just grinding the large number of hours. Certainly hours are important, for example you probably are not gonna publish a research paper, write a thesis, write a dissertation, or be successful in a faculty job without putting in more than 40 hours a week and some overnights. But, those should not be the norm. There are ways to design your life so that those are few and far between. Striving for a physical and mental balance is extremely important and my years of grinding have taken a toll. Although they have given me a lot, and I’ve been able to achieve tenure, looking back I now see how I could have changed my processes to work fewer hours, be more physically healthy, more mentally available for my friends and family, and produce more.\nMuch of this starts with prioritizing your physical health. You simply can’t reach your top productivity if you are not physically healthy because the mind-body connection is strong. Physical health is a cornerstone for long-term productivity in any career. And science is no different. After years of mucking through different processes, workflows, and trial and error, I’m finally starting to reach an understanding regarding how to construct these processes to reduce decision fatigue and be more productive, allow me more time to do more things outside of work and to take care of myself my family. This all involves standardization. Jocko Willink is famous for his mantra “Discipline Equals Freedom”. This mantra also holds true in creative work such as academia. Although it seems counterintuitive and potentially restricting at first, standardized processes actually allow you to do better, more creative, more reproducible, and more creative and inspiring work. > All it takes to make creativity a part of your life is the willingness to make it a habit. It is the product of preparation and effort, and is within reach of everyone. - Twyla Tharp\nThis is because all of the small decisions that you make about, for example (just to name a few):\n\nWhat to name files and how to create a structure in a folder or set of folders,\nwhat app to use to do data analysis,\nhow to write and structure code,\nwhat to do next when you have 15 minutes in your work schedule,\n\nreduce your ability to focus on what really matters, generating data, analyzing data, the science and the writing. By standardizing workflows and processes, we relegate the trivial stuff to a trusted system This system is one that holds important information, and allows you to access it freely and readily, but makes all of the trivial decisions for you. This allows you to focus on just the information. It frees you to think more and more deeply about what really matters, to focus your time and effort outside of work on your physical and mental health.\n\n\n\n10 years ago, very few people were doing open science. Now with openscapes and a handful of other strong initiatives more and more people are doing open science in environmental fields. More journals require that you submit raw data, code or somehow package everything to make your analysis and results reproducible. This workflow will allow you to do that automatically as you build your project. When you get to the point of submitting a manuscript you will already have a citable online repository that you can point to when you submit your manuscript. This workflow also fosters a mindset of development and growth, where you “show your work” all the time. Showing your work all the time is a great way to:\n\nFoster collaboration,\nto be “constantly producing”, and\n\nto feel more accomplished and feel that you can be “done” at the end of a workday day.\n\nIn the beginning you may find implementing this workflow to be slower, and at first there will be a learning curve. However after 18 years of managing projects and doing science, I can tell you the time effort and mental strain saved from having an organized, standardized, and open process and workflow will save you an incredible amount of time, but it can also provide you a strong foundation that you can carry into the future and never duplicate or backtrack on work you have already done. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gone back to read a paper that I’ve read five times just to fit it into another reference, or to format a bibliography, or to make sense of code that I wrote just six months ago, or to update the class syllabus documents or find different versions of files that are scattered across my computer, in cloud storage, and named different things. As you go on in your research career you will accumulate more and more of this baggage. If you start with a standardized workflow early in your career, this baggage will be manageable, well structured, available to you and others, and will actually promote a positive feedback loop whereby the work that you do now makes future work even easier and more creative.\n\n\n\nI am a traveler on this road as well. I do not have all of the answers, but I have spent time developing a system and set of tools that have begun to pay huge dividends in my work and personal life. I hope to share these lessons learned with you.\nI hope you will join me on this journey."

    "text": "This workflow is based on an open approach to science. The driving philosophy behind this approach is that every part of your project should be open and transparent to the greatest extent possible - from the very beginning of the project. For example, you may be collecting data on private land that is not acceptable to released to the public until the private partner has agreed and the project is published. However your advisor, your project collaborators, and the partners are stakeholders on your project certainly have a vested interest in understanding what you’ve collected, where you are with data processing and analysis, and accessing the the data in a form that is easy for them. Even though data may not yet be fully public at this stage it is still open science in the sense that you are “showing your work”. A major philosophy behind this workflow is that showing your work is important, and it fosters collaboration and high quality, reproducible science. “Showing your work” in an open and reproducible way at every project stage also allows others in our lab group or program to learn from and build on your data and code.\nUnderstanding this workflow will take some time. It will likely require you to change the way that you work, sometimes in ways that might seem annoying at the outset. For example instead of setting up your own spreadsheet for physical samples that you collected on your local computer, this workflow will ask you to build a survey 123 app through ArcGIS Online for all of your physical sample data logging in the field. It will then ask you to write a small R script that takes that survey 123 data and enters it in a master spreadsheet that we keep for all physical samples taken on all projects for a lab. This will assign every one of your physical samples unique ID number that differentiates it from all of the physical samples taken from all of the projects in our lab. It links each physical sample to a project and a purpose, this helps avoid the many vaguely labelled Ziploc bags and various samples that accumulate, creates early on in the project a physical referenceable sample archive, and ensures that your physical samples are available for you and others to use well into the future. That’s just one example.\nMany other portions of this workflow may ask you to learn a skill that you don’t yet have. Those skills may be related to data management, data architecture, understanding and ensuring that metadata is properly curated, and certainly, coding. You can all learn all of these skills. Yes, you! You are fully capable. Even if you have never touched a computer before.\nNot only are these skills important for this workflow, but this workflow implements some of the most cutting edge concepts in data science today. The skills that you develop through implementing this workflow can be cited on your résumé and are highly marketable, highly sought after skill sets in any career field in today’s world. In short, I’m asking for your full buy in. It is always tempting to cut corners in the name of speed, but I’m asking you not to do that, and I’m asking you to join me as we make the pledge to do things in a standardized way that will lead to greater efficiencies and work saved in the future."

    "title": "Introduction",
    "section": "Workflow Stages",
    "text": "Workflow Stages\nThe sections of this book each outline a single component of an integrated workflow that attempts at every turn to use well-documented, open source tools. The major components of this workflow are:\n\nProject Setup\nThis includes deciding what constitutes a project (seems like it should be an easy thing, but it’s actually somewhat difficult), and how to use a template to generate a file and folder structure for your project before you even begin that is deeply integrated across platforms. This also includes understand what “type” of project yours is - as this dictates how you will set the project up and collect and curate data.\nOnce you have your project defined and set up along with the folder structure across platforms, the next step is to begin producing documentation for your project. This is called project metadata and it is extremely important. Your project metadata gives you and others a general idea of the scope of the project, the motivation behind the project, where is going, when it is happening, and where the finals results and data will live.\nNot all projects that you begin will get to some final stage, however all projects should have a project structure and metadata even if these are empty. In fact, setting up a project with even just a trivial amount of meta-data and data structure encourages you to work more easily on that project in the future. This includes creating a badge or sticker that defines and brands each project. Although this might seem completely trivial, it actually helps you to view your project as an entity that is ready to be discussed and shared - even in its infancy by others, by your collaborators, or by your peers. It’s a fun way to stick your claim on a piece of ground that you are working on. There’s a whole section in this book on how to design and create a project sticker.\n\n\n“Pre”-Data\nBefore you start collecting data, and before you get to the point of looking at your raw data that you have collected, it’s important to set up pre-processes that allow you to standardize your data input and make it more easily retrievable in the future. This pre-data workflow include setting up a survey 123 app for data collection for field projects, designing and setting up data sheets, and for non-field projects, setting up meta-analysis structures or data forms.\n\n\nRaw Data Collection\nIn this stage, you generate your raw data. As you collect your data, you will use your pre-data structure and tools ensure that all of your raw data is captured, archived, and organized as you are doing it. This is ensures the highest quality data and also serves as an insurance policy against data loss. Avoiding unlabeled bags, pictures, or data sheets or notebooks that doesn’t contain the relevant information. Your pre-data steps and pre-data structure will ensure that this doesn’t happen.\n\n\nData Munging\nIn the data munging stage do you conduct QAQC and further curate your raw data, in a transparent and reproducible manner, and make decisions about how to best process your raw data to feed into your data analysis stage.\n\n\nData Analysis and Interpretation\nThe data analysis stage is probably the longest stage, and in fact it may start before you even have all of your data. The data analysis stage involves taking your pre-processed (“munged”) data and doing analysis on it in a transparent and reproducible way. This means that you will need to learn how to code. In my lab group we primarily use R. R is extremely flexible and widely used in soil science. Other scientific fields prefer python, and you may have a project where a different programming language makes more sense. That’s OK. But if you don’t know where to begin or what do use, I would suggest R. The data analysis step ends when you have produced tables or figures that allow you to begin interpreting your data and your results. Note that your tables and figures may not be final for a very long time - and you will likely be engaged in cycles of data analysis, writing, and further data analysis as you refine your interpretations. But it’s important to start somewhere and if you document your data analysis in a reproducible and transparent way, you won’t duplicate efforts down the road and will learn from all of your dead ends, particularly when it comes to coding.\nSetting poorly written or poorly managed code aside for even a week or two can cost you many hours when you come back to it. The goal is to have everything so well documented that you can hop back into a project and within 30 minutes be moving along at the place where you left off. This involves documenting many stages of your data analysis, which can see sometimes to slow you down while you are doing it. However, I can conifdently say that any time spent documenting and logging during data analysis is time saved by an order of magnitude when you inevitably are going back for the 20th 30th or 40th time into your scripts into your data and trying to make sense at all. Do it right the first time and even your dead ends will remain learning experiences that are well documented and allow you to move forward in a different path with your analysis.\n\n\nWriting\nThis section is about both the tools that we use for writing, and the philosophy of writing itself. Writing can be one of the most challenging parts of the job. It doesn’t have to be. We know so much about the philosophy of writing, and there are many tools to improve our writing and productivity. We can all learn to be better writers, we can all be more productive writers, and this aims to help you understand the philosophy of getting there. But in more practical sense, I hope to give you some tools that allow you to write in a more reproducible and transparent way to reduce writing and work stress. Part of that means being more efficient at writing down and logging everything.\nThis can be accomplished through the use of a personal knowledge management system (PKM). My system of choice is Obsidian (digital) and a Bullet Journal (analog). In addition to a PKM, getting in the habit of documenting writing notes and ensuring long-term viability of the notes that you created is extremely important. It means you will write faster, because you will never start with a blank page again. You always start writing with a structured outline text that was generated in the past, notes, thoughts or other things that have been all consolidated and maintained in your PKM - a trusted system where you don’t have to worry about losing thoughts or progress and is available to you whenever you choose to start working on writing in your project.\nThe reality is writing is not a discrete stage of a project that starts after data analysis. In this workflow writing begins with project definitions and project metadata and it doesn’t stop until the project or manuscript is submitted. Writing is continuous - you will revise things 20 or 30 times. Coding is also writing - in fact the best examples of well written code mean making that code not just readable for machines but also humans.\nMost science is collaborative, and nowadays writing will occur likely with collaborators - at a minimum me as your advisor, a group of scientists on a small project, or a large group of people working on a large project. It’s important to manage tools for version control, tools for collaboration in real time, and tools for rendering your documents so that you don’t have to spend time formatting. Formatting can take forever, but with modern tools like markdown language, publishing tools like Quarto, we can create from the same plain text document beautiful websites which can be referenced and cited by doi, we can create journal article submissions in PDF form that include all tables and figures, and we can house that same PKM system, which allows it to be searchable and usable to build on in other projects in the future.\nNOTE: these discrete project stages overklap significantly. Except for project definition and project management, for example. Writing and data analysis often take place at the same time because we “write to learn”.\nTODO: how to take notes (strategies - smart notes), revisit and improve your metadata, writing philosophies and writing to learn.\nNOTE: keep a data analysis log - keep a writing log\n\n\nLong term data archiving and storage\nGitHub is the main repository for code and data from projects in this lab, but also any data generated including spatial data for should go into a major database either hosted or sponsored by a stable entity. Long-term archiving also includes packaging up your entire project structure, which now should be standardized based on this lab work flow, so anybody in our lab, or anybody reading this documentation knows exactly what each folder means where to find certain files how to run code, even 10 or 20 years into the future. This workflow is designed to be as future proof as possible.\nNote that although these major components are listed in chronological order, they will likely not necessarily occur in distinct stages in your project. For example data analysis may begin with preliminary data and continue as you are writing drafts of manuscripts, AND writing occurs across all of these components - writing actually begins with project setup as you will see. If you have a project idea, you can start writing! This allows you to never start with a blank page\nTo execute this standardized workflow as described, it will be necessary for you to be familiar with and utilize the following tools:\n\nArcGIS Online: Survey123 (Proprietary - Free account available through UMN)\nObsidian (Open source)\nZotero (Open source)\nQGIS (Open source)\nR/RStudio (Open source)\nGitHub/GitHub Desktop (Proprietary - Free account available to anyone)\nGoogle Drive (Proprietary - Free account available to anyone, unlimited storage available through UMN)\nInkScape (Open source)\nHack MD (Proprietary - Free account available to anyone)\nnote to potentially include social professional sites like ResearchGate and Google Scholar + ORCID + X?\n\nThese are not a randomly selected group of tools - they are designed at every turn to allow deep integration and (as much as possible) free and open source usage. Although not all of these tools are open source (ArcGIS Online, GitHub, Google Drive, Hack MD) with the exception of ArcGIS Online, all of these tools have a free base level, which will be sufficient to execute this workflow. Additionally, because of UMN’s enterprise license with ArcGIS Online, all of those tools are available free to you if you are in our graduate or undergraduate programs.\nThese tools will require you to be fluent in the following languages:\n\nR (core language, critical skill)\nMarkdown (core language, critical skill)\nAlthough not required to execute this workflow, familiarity with Python, Javascript, and SQL might help you do more customization"

    "text": "This workflow is designed around discrete units of work called projects and utilizes Tiago Forte’s PARA file structure and organization. The PARA system (Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive) is an excellent place to start for organizing your files - if you don’t have strong feelings about how your work files are organized on your computer, I highly suggest starting with this. If you do have strong feelings, you can always adapt the system to something that works for you. Utilizing this system doesn’t necessarily commit you to going back and re-organizing all of your work files on your computer. Just start now, and build as you go and work on new projects. As you have time in the future, you can always go back and fit your previous work into this structure. However - see my notes on things to watch for when you go back to “refactor” your files and folder structure.\nThe most important thing is to start now; start today, with the project you are working on.\nThe second most important thing is to use the same structure across apps, platforms, and languages, which will allow deep integration and ensure you always know where everything is. You will spend less time trying to find for example, a small test R script you wrote last year or that interesting thing you read 18 months (or 2 months!) ago that was related to this project. The PARA system also explicitly focuses attention on those units of work (i.e. Projects) that are the most critical (in an R1 institution these would be manuscripts and proposals - even for us teaching faculty!)."

    "section": "1.1 The PARA system in practice",
    "text": "1.1 The PARA system in practice\nTiago Forte’s PARA acronym stands for: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive. This system is not strictly hierarchical, but each category from front to back in PARA is given precedence over the last. That is because the underlying philosophy is that projects should produce end outputs or deliverables. Things that are not yet projects, or are larger than a single project are more nebulous, but not any less valuable.\nUsing the PARA system requires you to set up high level folders (I would suggest in the Documents directory of your computer) for each of the PARA categories: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive. Then, all of your professional work, and eventually some of your personal work and interests will nest under these.\nDeciding what is a “Project” vs an “Area” vs a “Resource” vs an “Archive” is probably the most important part of this workflow and drives everything else, so I will start there. One simple way to think about this is that when you need to consider where something should go in this system start at the beginning - if its doesn’t fit into the definition of a “Project”, then move down and see if it fits into the definition of an “Area”. If it is not an “Area”, then it will likely be a “Resource” unless it is something completed or inactive, in which case it goes in the “Archive”."

    "text": "1.2 What is a Project? How should I name my Projects?\n\n1.2.1 Defining Projects - How to Determine if Something is a Project\nThis seems like a trivial question but defining project boundaries in research can be difficult. Where does one project end and another begin? Does a project include multiple sub projects?\nA project is something you are involved in that has a discrete, definable end state or product. Note that our definition of projects here means they are flat. There should not be multiple projects nested under other projects. Each project is a discrete entity - this aligns with GitHub repository organization (as we will see in future chapters), which allows deep integration. In our line of work, examples would be:\n\nA thesis chapter; see below for why a thesis or dissertation itself is actually larger than a Project - it is an Area\nA manuscript\nA proposal\nConference presentations and invited lectures (one-time - not recurring teaching responsibilities)\nReports to stakeholders on unpublished data. NOTE: grant reports (as addressed below) are not projects, but belong in areas with grants.\nNOTE: A grant is best defined as an Area (because these days all grants are collaborative) with multiple projects underneath. Also, because most grants actually have multiple end products such as reports and manuscripts.\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Naming Projects\nThis is a general style guide for naming projects (in the context of files or folder structures). Projects may have very long actual names (or you may not even know what, exactly the name of your project or project idea will eventually be). This doesn’t matter for the purposes of project setup. For now, we just need a two to four word abbreviated title for the project that we will use in our folder structure.\n\n1.2.2.1 Naming Manuscripts - standardized with unique IDs as these will become GitHub repos\nAll manuscripts (following project setup) will eventually have a GitHub repo which is built from the jelinski-lab-pedology-MXXX-project-template repo, and therefore coordinated and standardized naming is essential. Here is a style guide for naming your projects:\n\nUse all lowercase letters and short dashes instead of spaces.\nManuscripts should be designated as M (for manuscript, including thesis chapters, which should each be a publishable unit).\nProjects should then be given a three digit number (with two leading zeros for any project numbers under 100) - these are just given in sequence as we create projects - the order doesn’t matter. **If you are in my lab group*, please obtain a new project ID number by adding your project as a new row to (jelinski-lab-project-registry?). Simply add a row with the next number in sequence (i.e. if the last registered project is M059-jelinski-permafrost-table-id, then your project should be M060-).\nProject numbers are followed by the last name of the project lead.\nThen all projects should have a 2-4 word descriptive title (note - spend at least a bit of time thinking about this as this is what will be used on all other platforms (your personal computer, GitHub, GoogleDrive, etc…) as your project name.\n\nYour final project name is a combination of components 2 to 5 as follows: Lets say I wanted to create a project structure for the “Techniques for Field Identification of the Permafrost Table” manuscript I am working on, and lets say it is the 59th project in the registry.\nMy project name is then TypeNumber-Word1-Word2-Word3. So, the project name for my manuscript would be:\nM059-jelinski-permafrost-table-ID\n\n\n1.2.2.2 Naming Proposals\nAll lab-wide proposals (following project setup) will eventually have a GitHub repo which is built from the jelinski-lab-pedology-MXXX-project-template repo, and therefore coordinated and standardized naming is essential. Here is a style guide for naming your projects:\nProposals should be designated PL or PI (for proposal lab or proposal individual (see below)) and numbered by year. If the proposal is awarded then the entire proposal folder is copied to a grants folder in Areas (see below) with the same number. Group-wide grants (i.e. that Nic writes) start with the big PL label. Individual grants (student grants or personal applications) get a PI label so they do not conflict. Basically Nic is the only one who creates group proposal projects that are registered on the (jelinski-lab-project-registry?). Your proposals (which should start with PI) can have your own numbers, starting with 01).\nProposal names begin with PL or PI, then add the two digit year, and a unique two digit proposal ID. For numbers less than 10, pad to the left with a zero. Then, add your name, the name of the funder, and a short two to four word descriptive title.\nExamples: - PL23-05-jelinski-maelc-soil-texture - PI23-01-ainuddin-cogs-travel-grant\n\n\n1.2.2.3 Naming Conference Presentations and Lectures\nConference presentations and invited lectures do not need to be named and coordinated across all lab members, so ID numbers do not need to be unique. Many conference presentations may eventually end up in manuscript repos if a published manuscript presents the data.\nConference presentations or invited lectures begin with C or L, followed by the two digit year, person giving the presentation, conference or meeting name, and two to four word descriptive name.\nExamples: - C22-03-jelinski-sssa-cryoturbation-review - L23-01-jelinski-waterresources-soil-landscape-health"

The following are examples of Areas:\n\nTeaching a course or invited lectures.\nGrants (including grant reports). Although grants do have a definable end date, they should still be areas because they are highly collaborative and typically have multiple projects under them.

Projects end with a bang!\nService\nEmployment related items such as annual reviews or summaries\n\n\n\n1.3.2 Naming Areas\nArea names can be a bit more general than project names and (with the exception of grants) they are more personal so do not need to be registered or have a GitHub repository (although they certainly can if it makes sense).\n\n1.3.2.1 Naming Grants\nAll lab-wide proposals (following project setup) which are funded become grants. The contents of the proposal folder are copied into Areas and the name remains the same except the PL or PI is removed and replaced with G. Grants should also eventually have a GitHub repo which is built from the jelinski-lab-pedology-MXXX-project-template repo, and therefore coordinated and standardized naming is essential. Here is a style guide for naming your projects: NOTE - need to create project folder/repo template for grants\n\n\n1.3.2.2 Naming Teaching Folders/Repositories\nTeaching folder should start with a T and then the two digit year followed by the course number and semester. Teaching folders may or may not have an associated GitHub repo - they should definitely have a Google Drive folder/archive of the same name. NOTE - need to create project folder template for teaching?\nExamples: - T23-soil2125-spring\n\n\n1.3.2.3 Naming Service Folders/Repositories\nService obligations are personal and therefore do not need to be coordinated across lab members. As service obligations can stretch across many years, these are not labelled by year - simply sequentially.\nExamples: - S07-cfans-uprc"

I know what that is and I only have one project right now anyway…\nIf you are early in your career, this may seem unneccessary. But I can promise you this is actually the perfect time to start. This folder structure allows you to do five things:\n\ncreate a publicly available repository out of any one of your project directories at anytime with little to no work\nshare your folder with anyone in our lab group (or anyone who reads this workflow document) who with little further direction will be able to understand your files and where to locate things\nmaintain an increasingly complex and growing list of projects and areas as you move forward in your career with little to no headache\nspend little to no time finding exactly what you are looking for. As you grow this system, the numbers associated with particular projects will become secondhand nature - “oh that manuscript is M007”.\nas you complete projects or certain areas are no longer relevant to your job, you can move whole folders into the archive without compromising your ability to find things. Note, in the example above, how two manuscript folders (M01 and M02) have been moved to the archive. They retain the numbers I associated with them when I was working on them."

Setting up this standardized project subfolder structure will allow you to have a place to put everything related to your project in a clear way, without having to think extensively about where something should go.

    "text": "2.5 What Do Each of These Folders Mean and What Should I Put in Them?\nAlthough this list may seem daunting at first, each of these folders has a purpose, and this structure allows for deep integration with transparent data curation and data analysis workflows using R. Some of these folders may remain empty for the duration of your project and that is just fine! Note that each of the folders have a number convention for quick association once you start using this standardized structure. The numbers also allow for the folders to be arranged in a logical order, rather than alphabetically.\n\n2.5.1 /00-data\nThis folder contains all of the input data being used in this project. EVERY dataset (whether external or project generated) should have an associated metadata file! For complex projects with many datasources, each dataset should live in its own subfolder.\n\n2.5.1.1 /00-data/a-raw\nThe raw data: unmodified, comprehensive, containing outliers, missing values, imperfections and other items that may be removed in data pre-processing (sometimes called “munging”78). Insert link to data pre-processing chapter. It also contains any foundational geospatial data from other authors/sources that you did not generate but that you are pulling in for the purposes of analysis and that needs further processing to be utilized in your workflow. For example if an external data source came in a proprietary format that needed to be exported and modified. Note - need to create a subfolder separate for this, and also need to have a way to track origin and authorship - probably a readme or metadata file .txt or something - can be a running open file that is added to - maybe a markdown or something?\nAny raw data that you generated should be in open and easily readable formats. Raw data from other sources may not be in these open and readable formats and require further processing or preparation to make usable Specifically:\n\nTabular data should be in .csv format\nSpatial vector data (points, lines or polygons) should be in OGC geopackage format.\n\nAny data in raw data that is not your own should be in an /external-sources subdirectory which contains a metadata file that details the source of each of the external data sources.\n\n\n2.5.1.2 /00-data/b-prepared\nThis folder is the sink where all of your post-processed data will live. It also contains any foundational geospatial data from other authors/sources that you did not generate but that you are pulling in for the purposes of analysis following any necessary processing to change formats - note that this can include reprojected data, etc? actually maybye it shouldn’t because all of that can go into an R script - hmm need to think about this. Note - need to create a subfolder separate for this, and also need to have a way to track origin and authorship - probably a readme or metadata file .txt or something - can be a running open file that is added to - maybe a markdown or something? Data should be in open and easily readable formats. Specifically:\n\nTabular data should be in .csv format\nSpatial vector data (points, lines or polygons) should be in OGC geopackage format.\nSpatial raster data should be in GeoTIFF format.\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 /01-code\nThis folder contains all of your source code and R scripts that you use to conduct your data processing and analysis as well as markdowns which describe your processing pipeline in depth (if you choose).\n\n2.5.2.1 /01code/a-Rscripts\nThis folder contains all of your R scripts. Note link to how to actually write and breakdown and organize scripts and analysis in projects - this can be in your R style guide or as a separate section - talk about sequential numbering, a master script, functions script, global script, readme, and how to renumber or keep your growing scripts squared away.\n\n\n2.5.2.2 /01code/b-markdowns\nThe idea for this folder comes from the pipeline subfolder idea from Ties de Kok9. Ties suggests that every script file in 01-code has a subfolder in a 02-pipeline subflder. Within each subfolder are three other directories: tmp, store, and out. Per Ties10:\n\n02_pipeline/sub-folder/out contains files that you save with the intention of loading them in a future code file. These are usually the “end-products” of the current code file.\n\n\n02_pipeline/sub-folder/store contains files that you save with the intention of loading them in the current code file. This is, for example, used in scenarios where it takes a while to run parts of your code and to avoid having to re-run these parts every time you might want to intermittently save the progress of your generated data to the store folder.\n\n\n02_pipeline/sub-folder/tmp contains files that you save for inspection purposes or some other temporary reason. The basic principle is that you should not have to worry about anything in the tmp folder being deleted as it only serves a temporary purpose.\n\nI really like this idea, however in reflecting think that a similar thing can be accomplished with markdown files and/or a quarto ebook. I want to keep the script folder clean and just R scripts (don’t want to junk it up with markdowns), so I actually think the best solution is to have a separate folder for markdowns. Note that these markdowns can then be used as inputs to build an ebook with Quarto and display as a GitHub Pages website.\nSo, this folder is to store markdowns from the individual scripts, or from groups of scripts. NOTE: NEVER EVER copy and paste code from R scripts to markdowns - the potential for error is just too high. Instead, call R scripts within the markdowns1112.\n\n\n\n2.5.3 /02-output\nThis folder contains final, polished figures and tables or other products that will go in the manuscript. Note - although the /04-manuscript folder has subfolders for tables and figures, these are not necessarily the same thing. Any figures and tables in /02-output are generated from your code and source data. It is likely/possible that you may also end up with manuscript figures and tables that are not generated from your source data (conceptual figures, logic models, etc).\n\n2.5.3.1 /02-output/a-figures\nFigures generated from data-code workflow in R\n\n\n2.5.3.2 /02-output/b-tables\nTables generated from data-code workflow in R\n\n\n\n2.5.4 /03-support-files\nThe support files folder contains information that may help support understanding of your project development, workflow, and speed up processing through the use of a cache. However these files should NEVER be strictly necessary for reproducing your data, analysis, and outputs.\n\n2.5.4.1 /03-support-files/archive\nThis folder contains anything that is not relevant to the current workflow but that you are not ready to delete permanently yet. Items can be moved to the archive folder at any time. Consider including in git-ignore.\n\n\n2.5.4.2 /03-support-files/cache\nYour cache folder may not be used often. However it is there to provide a storage place for any large objects or data that take a very long time to generate initially in a script. When these are generated once, they can be exported to this folder - this provides a shortcut for subsequent running of the scripts that saves time. People can still run your original scripts to generate these objects if they so choose.\n\n\n2.5.4.3 /03-support-files/logs\nThis folder contains logs related to your project, specifically your analysis log and writing log. You can choose to make these public or not. See this section for how to write and construct logs - do it at the end of every day/session - take the 5 MINUTES!!!\n\n\n2.5.4.4 /03-support-files/temp\nThe temp folder is basically to hold any temporary non-important files, such as tests script outputs, test figures, etc. These are not important to the overall analysis. This folder should be not be included in your final project using [.gitignore] file.\n\n\n\n2.5.5 /04-manuscript\nThis folder houses everything related to manuscripts or reports resulting from the project. It has subfolders for holding drafts, submitted versions (inclduign subsequent revisions), final and proofs, final figures & tables, and references (which contains a single .bib file - ideally exported from your Zotero project folder which matches the name of this project).\n\n2.5.5.1 /04-manuscript/a-drafts\nManuscript drafts. If there are critical draft versions (like those sent to collaborators at certain times, those should get a subfolder with date of draft - i.e. 10JAN2023). You do not need to save regular working drafts with specific dates unless you choose. There should be further figures, tables, and refs subfolders within those containing the versions of figures and tables used, and a .bib file in the refs folder.\n\n\n2.5.5.2 /04-manuscript/b-submitted\nSubmitted versions of manuscripts should be placed in a subfolder in here with date of submission - i.e. 10JAN2023). There should be further figures, tables, and refs subfolders within those containing the versions of figures and tables used, and a .bib file in the refs folder.\n\n\n2.5.5.3 /04-manuscript/c-final-and-proofs\nFinal accepted version of manuscript and galley proofs."

Malcom Barrett gave an an excellent talk at the useR! 2020 conference entitled “Why use the here package when you’re already using projects?”. The .Rproj file contained in this tenplate is pre-configured to start with a completely clean workspace EVERY TIME by selecting in Project Options > General “Restore .RData into workspace at startup” = NO and “Save workspace to .RData on exit” = NO, “Disable .Pprofile execution on session start/resume” = CHECKED, “Quit child processes on exit” = CHECKED. These two options combined will also ensure that others running your code (or even you at a later date) don’t experience errors or conflictions due to workspace-specific background16 - this is often the cause of the following issue: “I swear…my code worked the last time I ran it and I didn’t change anything!”.\n\n\n2.6.5 README.md\nThis is arguably one of the most important features of your entire project.

However, as your project grows and changes, your readme should be updated. Be as thorough as possible. Note that this is a project level readme. Although not required, you should strongly consider including sub readmes at within multipl subfolders where necessary. Conversely, you can create a project level book in Quarto that contains all readmes and documentation (see section X). More information on how to use and write a readme in section X.\n\n2.6.5.1 A note on a TODO list. Do not keep a list of TODOs in a separate file. Instead log them as issues on GitHub.

    "text": "4.2 What is the difference between github.com and github.umn.edu and where should my project go?\nFirst and most importantly, the University Enterprise version of GitHub github.umn.edu is a private instance of GitHub that is accessible only to students, faculty and staff (i.e. you must have a UMN x500 number to access it). Apart from the standard GitHub interface, look and feel, it is on completely different servers and does not talk to public GitHub. If you no longer have an x500, you will not be able to access UMN Enterprise GitHub. Because you may not be at the University of Minnesota for your entire career, you should generally default to setting up and using your personal profile on public GitHub, which you will be able to maintain and access in perpetuity. However, there are some limited instances when the UMN Enterprise version of GitHub might be preferred:\n\nYou want to create a repository that is only accessible to UMN students, faculty and staff.\nYou want to publish a Quarto book using GitHub Pages for a class, but only want students who are in the class at UMN to be able to see and access it. NOTE: generally speaking, I am of the philosophy that most general class materials such as the syllabus, lab manuals, and other exercises should be public, however there are some class items such as student submissions and essays that you would not want to be public. However for most classes, the use for GitHub would just be to publish a stable link to a Quarto book using GitHub Pages and point to it in your Canvas course site, since Canvas is the platform of choice for classes. Everything else regarding class management can and should be done in Canvas with the exception of some computer science classes that are writing and submitting code on GitHub as a matter of professional practice. UMN Enterprise GitHub instance makes a lot of sense for those classes but not for many others.\nYou want to “show your work as you go” on a project in this workflow, by utilizing a project book (modeled on Hava’s procedure), but do not want others to see this until you are ready to share it. On github.umn.edu, you can create a private repository and publish a Quarto rendered book using GitHub pages that only you will be able to see or that you will be able to tighly control access on. NOTE: On public GitHub, you have the ability to set repo access to private. However, when using the free tier of GitHub, you cannot publish a Quarto book to GitHub Pages unless your repo is public. Therefore, in order to keep a repo private and keep a book-based project and analysis log, everyone will be able to see your progress. Maybe this is ok, maybe it isn’t it is up to you and the nature of your project. Conversely - the “Team” tier for GitHub is (as of 2022) $44/yr, and allows you to publish private GitHub pages from private repos where you control access.\n\nBottom line: if you are a graduate student working on a project as part of your thesis, you can initiate your repo on UMN Enterprise GitHub if you choose (that way you won’t have to worry about privacy and can publish to GitHub Pages without paying). Especially for your first repo and when you are learning to use GitHub, this will also allow you to experiment with Git functionality without fear of public access in any way, shape, or form. However, just be aware then when your project moves to final stages you will need to create a new repository on your public GitHub and push from the repo on your local computer - you cannot simply mirror your UMN Enterprise repo to public GitHub. Not a big deal either way, but you should plan ahead for what is most appropriate for your project."

There are other options for interacting with GitHub and GitHub repos - such as command line tools and through R Studio, but until you know the basics and understand what is happening and when, using command line tools will likely be more confusing. Once you know what you are doing, it can sometimes be more convenient to interact with your repos through R Studio (seldom is the command line more convenient), but its really not that much more convenient. Bottom line: Set up and use GitHub Desktop unless you have a compelling reason not to!"

Also, the project feels more official and branded, which can sometimes be a kick in the pants to get moving, esp if public.\nHow to decide when to make a repo on GitHub - some options:\n\nAnytime!\nOnce you have some materials in your project folder\nOnce the project is well defined\n\nit’s common for dissertation chapters and non-data (i.e. review or big idea manuscripts (what I will call luxury manuscripts) to be nebulous and change). These are usually not very collaborative either. You can wait to make GitHub repos for these until they coalesce or become better defined.

The default license for projects in our lab is the MIT license.\n\n\n\n4.7.2 Jelinski Lab GitHub Workflow Follows GitHub Flow\nOur standard GitHub workflow follows the well documented GitHub flow process, which is a branch based workflow:\n\nIf you are the sole person working on a repository, you can get away with pushing and pulling from the /main branch.\nHowever, if you are working on your repository with others (or even by yourself, but want to ensure you don’t inadvertently change your main branch while making edits and changes), you should create a branch within the repo and give it a descriptive name. You can modify, push and pull from the branch, and allow others to see what you have done.\nEventually, once you are happy with your changes (if you wish) merge it with the main branch to update everything. GitHub has some excellent tools for merging and for controlling through “pull request merges](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request).\nAfter a branch has been fully merged, it can be deleted and pruned without loss of information as deleting a branch does not delete the commit history.\n\n\n\n4.7.3 Guidelines for Pushing to Your Repo\nAdditionally, you should do the following when working with your GitHub repo:\n\nStrive to commit and push to your repo at the end of each day of work on a project or at small milestones in your work. Writing good commit messages (see below) will help you understand when to do that. Don’t wait long periods of time to push your local repo/directory to your GitHub repo! This is incremental work!\nEvery commit should contain a good commit message, and a detailed description where possible. General guidelines that we will follow whihc are adapted from Robert Painsi, (Bolaji Ayodeji, including example from Tim Pope Toni Bardina and GitKraken:\n\nCommit messages should have an entry in the subject and body\nSubject line should be capitalized and less than 50 characters\nSpaces are allowed\nNo period at end of subject line, punctuations allowed in body of message (description on GitHub Desktop)\nSubject line written in imperative mode (i.e. Add, not Added or Adds)\nSubject line should begin with one of the following verbs (which are adapted from their comp sci meanings to what best fits our work - see full list here):\n\nAdd - added a document, file, code, or section within a document\nDelete - added a document, file, code, or section within a document\nEdit - edited a document, file, code, or section within a document\nFix - fix an issue e.g. bug, typo, accident, misstatement.\nStart - begin doing something\nStop - end doing something\nRefactor - reorganize or refactor code\nRestructure - reorganize or refactor directory or project structure\nDocument - editing, changing or adding to metadata\n\n\nThe commit message body should only contain what and never why or how. Whys and hows should go into documentation such as project logs (writing or analysis logs), metadata, or the project Quarto book (if you have one)."

You should then set up a folder (i.e. subcollection) under the 000-projects folder that is named the same as your project directory or repo name (i.e. “M009-jelinski-permafrost-table-id”). This ensures that you collect relevant references in a folder that has exactly the same name as your repo or directory. The key is association, number and name - across apps."

This allows you to begin building a bibliography before you even begin writing your manuscript in earnest. If you are searching for references online or come across a reference online, simply:\n\nMake sure Zotero is open\nEnsure your “000 Inbox” folder is highlighted\nClick the Zotero add-on icon in your browser to import the full paper reference (note: this also works for websites and books).\nIf you have access to the pdf (i.e. if it is open sources or if you are logged in to University internet or remotely through VPN to the University Libraries), the pdf will also be automatically downloaded and attached to your reference record.\n\n*NOTE: I prefer to send everything to the Inbox first and then later go through the inbox to shuffle records to the relevant folders. However, if you choose you could also highlight the relevant folder instead of 000 Inbox and Zotero will send the reference there instead of to your inbox. Note that Zotero allows you to place a single reference in two or more collections or subcollections without duplication of the original file. This is very handy. There are many other excellent Zotero features - not least of which is [Integration with Obsidian]#todo, merging duplicate references, text and area highlighting in PDFs, and sharing reference collections."

    "text": "6.1 Pre-Data Infrastructure\n\n6.1.1 Survey123 for tabular data, spatial data, and image collection\nOur standardized tool for data collection for field projects is ArcGIS Survey123. Survey123 is a tool that allows you to create customized data entry and submission forms that you can then access through the Survey123 app on your phone. These forms can be created through the ArcGIS Online Survey123 portal. Although it is a proprietary tool, all faculty, students and staff at UMN have full, free access to the ArcGIS Online suite of tools which includes Survey123. Despite the fact that Survey123 is proprietary and not open source, it is highly functional and therefore the ease of use makes it our tool of choice. This chapter assumes you are familiar and have accessed Survey123. If you have not worked with Survey123 before, it is well supported and documented by ESRI and you can check out our Tools: Survey123 chapter #todo in this book.\n\n\n6.1.2 Lab Standards for Survey123 Form\nAs you set up your Survey123 form, you should think through each of the pieces of information that will be important to collect in the field and provide a way to capture that information in your form. When in doubt - err on the side of including it in your form - you can always ignore it in the field while using the app if there is some redundancy.\nIf you are doing a field project, you should strongly consider using Survey123 to collect your plot or site-level data. Think of what unit of your sampling will have a unqiue latitude and longitude and that is the data collection unit that your survey form should be designed for. For example, if you have a project that requires taking soil cores, with multiple samples from different depths taken from each core, then the survey form should be designed around each of the cores, which will have a unqiue latitude and longitude, and not each of the samples (many of which from the same core will have the same latitude and longitude).\nSurvey123 excels at consolidating spatial data (latitudes and longitudes), tabular data (text, numbers, or X entered in response to questions on the form), and images (taken in response to questions on the form) in one location. When you submit each of your records, this raw data will live in the Survey123 database through ArcGIS Online that is associated with your form.\nOur laboratory standards for Survey123 forms is that they should (at a minimum) collect the following information:\n\nName of initials of person recording data or submitting record\nGPS location of record (autocollected in response to location question)\nDate and time of record collection (autocollected in response to time question)\nUnique plot or observation number in the context of the project\n\nYour Survey123 form should also include fields to enter all relevant raw data as required by your project.\n\n\n6.1.3 Additional Survey123 Functionality of Interest\nImages. Survey123 is an excellent way to collect and organize images. Single image submission questions can be configured to collect multiple images. Once submitted, all images are stored with the associated record in the online database.\nDeep Customization - XLSForms Deeper functionality for setting up forms in Survey123 requires a PC and the use of XLSForms and Survey123 Conect (a desktop app that only runs on Windows). While this is very annoying for us Mac users, it allows extensive customization of your Survey123 form, including but certainly not limited to:\n\nRepeats: “Repeats” allow you to generate multiple records (rows) from a single survey entry/submission - so for example, you can generate multiple rows for the master sample log (each row is a sample) from one submission form (plot or pedon): https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-survey123-blog/survey123-tricks-of-the-trade-repeats/ba-p/898041\nCustomizing File Names for Submitted Images: Customaization through XLS Forms allows you to set the file names of submitted photos - this is really important - automatically annotate photo file names with project, plot, and question or anything else from designated fields in the form (as well as date/time). This functionality can save significant time when you go to curate your photo archive. https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-survey123-blog/survey123-tricks-of-the-trade-set-the-file-name-of/ba-p/1217125\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Hard Copy Field Data Sheets\nSurvey123 is an excellent tool for collecting plot or site level data in the field with your phone. However, some types of field data collection are extremely difficult to digitize under field conditions. Examples of these are:\n\nSoil morphology data (lots of specialized acronyms, notes, and chicken scratches add depth to the data, often difficult to use phone while textureing soil, many fields and extremely time consuming to use an app or tablet in the field).\nData consisting of many numbers or that exists at the sample level. Remember I said that Survey123 really shines when used at the level of unique geospatial coordinates which is typically the plot or site level. However, often times we may also be collecting data at the sample level. For example recording the dimensions of a permafrost soil core section that will go into a sample bag, or the field pH and EC of a soil sample. These data are best collected using hard copy forms. There are examples of hard copy forms for field data collection that Megan Andersen put together in the Jelinski Lab Field Handbook repository [here]#todo. Always print your hard copy forms on Rite-In-The-Rain!!"

    "text": "6.2 Raw Data Collection\nAfter your pre-data infrastructure is set up, do some test runs and some mock data collection around campus. This will allow you to use your infrastructure, datasheets, and think through any missing pieces or functionality issues. Revise as needed and get ready for your travel - check out our [Field Manual]#todo for protocols and processes related to field work.\n\n6.2.1 Tips for using Survey 123 in the field\nSurvey 123 is generally an excellent app in the field, and most new phones are sufficiently durable and waterproof to be used in the field. As recently as 2019 I carried a separate digital camera and GPS. Now I do everything (capture GPS, take pictures, use Survey123 for tabular data) on my phone. *NOTE - this also means you should have a backup field ready rugged battery pack to charge your phone during the day if necessary in the field. There are also some other tips when using Survey123 in the field.\n\nImages. When choosing to use Survey123 as an image repository, ensure that you 1) take pictures with your phone and upload them to a survey response from your photo library (instead of taking them live through the app) - this ensures that if something goes wrong with the response you still have the image on your camera. The images will also be full quality this way, while taking them through the app may result in reduced quality and image compression. Additionally, make sure your survey is set up to receive and store original quality images - the default is compression so you need to change the default (google search how to do this and provide link here)#todo.\nOffline/Online. Unless you are in a populated area, you may not be able to upload survey responses live in the field. That is fine. Survey 123 allows you to save draft responses to your outbox which are stored locally on your phone. When you get back to a good internet connection, you can submit your survey responses.\nPhone GPS Accuracy. Even if you don’t have service or wifi signal, your phone GPS will be more accurate if you keep your cellular and wifi on. This will drain your battery faster in remote areas but the gain in accuracy is worth it. As mentioned above, for this reason, bring a field ready battery pack.\nGPS Backup. Always ensure that your phone is not your only source of GPS data to insure against data loss. There are several combinations you can use to achieve this:\n\nPhone + Hard Copy. Write down the Lat/Lon on your data sheet or notebook\nTwo Phone apps. Take GPS points with Survey123 & another app such as OnX.\nPhone + GPS unit. Take an indendent GPS unit in the field with you and take a GPS point at every plot or site. Store on the GPS unit.\n\nData Backup. Your data should be backed up each evening when you return from the field. Do this by: exporting images from your phone to a computer or external drive, taking pictures of all hard copy data sheets collected that day and backing them up to a computer or external drive, if you have a wifi connection, uploading tabular data and survey responses to Survey123 and downloading the updated version of the database."

    "text": "6.4 Standards for Creating the Raw Data Archive\nYou should strive to meet the following standards when curating your raw data archive:\n\nYour raw data archive should be generated within 1 week of returning from the field (if a single trip), or updated within 1 weeks of collection (for recurring work over longer periods).\nYour raw data archive should consist of:\n\na shapefile in OGC Geopackage format containing lat lon and point or plot IDs\ntabular data exported from Survey123\npictures or scans of your raw data sheets\na local image/video repository where images are placed in a uniqely named folder for each plot or site. NOTE: ideally the title of each folder, in addition to containing the plot or site code should also have a descriptive name alongside the plot code to jog your memory when you are looking back at your plots and images. For example “FRN-31 where we saw moose in lake”.\n\nNOTE: your images should contain metadata in their image names. Nowadays most image files will be exported from your phone with a unique number ID such as “IMG_6249”. You should always retain that number in your file name; BUT you should add additional metadata to the file name by appending: 1) the project id, 2) the plot id, 3) a one or two word phrase regarding the question the image was taken in repsonse to. So, for example, an excellent image title for an image with the name and the folder above would be: “FRN-31_pedon_IMG_6249”. Note that this can be done in an automated way using XLSForms in Survey123. If you want to really take this to the next level, also include some descriptive text in the image file name between the Survey123 generated material and the image file name i.e. “FRN-31_pedon_Bwhorizon30cm_IMG_6249”. *Alternatively, you can also use an open source desktop image metadata editing app such as DigiKam.\n\na file (preferrably in [Markdown]#todo) format which contains any additional qualitative information, notes, observations, or a brain dump from the field data collection - if applicable.\nour standardized [sample log file]#todo that details characteristics and names of physical samples taken.\na readme.txt file that contains metadata about your raw data archive. You can add to your existing readme file or Quarto book as well to include the files in your raw data subdirectory in the readme/metadata.\n\n\nThese files live in the raw data folder of your repo. However note that the image repository will be very large in some cases and gitHub is not a good place to store images. Therefore - in your [.gitignore file]#todo, you should include the image type or the image repository directory so that these do not upload to GitHub.\n\nYour raw data repository should be stored locally and somewhere in the cloud. For everything except your image/video repository should be stored on GitHub. The image/video repository should be stored locally and either in Flickr or a Shared Google Drive (a truly shared drive, not through your personal account) or Google Photos (same re: shared). NOTE #todo: should image repositories also be required to upload to CFANS Drive?\nYour raw data should also contain pre-data - including spreadsheet forms and an archive of the Survey123 form - in what format?#todo.\n\nNOTE: folder repo structure should contain a pre-data folder!!!!!#todo"

    "text": "6.5 Physical Sample Curation\nThe short- and long-term curation of physical samples collected during fieldwork is not trivial. There are several issues to be solved - sample names, sample log, and connecting your sample log to a laboratory sample log.\n\n6.5.1 Sample Names\nSee our field manual for detailed protocols on sample naming. Briefly, however, your physical samples should be collected in pre-labelled bags. These bags are pre-labelled with a two digit year and sample number. This allows you to collect samples in the field without labelling bags in difficult conditions. The sample log is then a critical piece of your raw data as it connects your sample numbers to metadata about the sample (depths, plot or site, and horizon, for example). Sample numbers then be something like “22-001”. NOTE; this assumes that you won’t collect more than 999 samples in a year (usually safe?). If projects are occuring at the same time, then we need a way of differentiating between these samples. We should therefore append the sample number with the last initials of the project lead who is collecting them in the field (i.e. “22-001-NAJ”).\n*NOTE: if you are working on an externally sponsored project or a project that has a larger collaborative team or more parts, your sample names may be prescribed for you. That is fine - in that case, use the sample naming conventions that are part of the larger project. - how will this work with master sample log integration?\n\n\n6.5.2 Sample Log\nUse the sample log template provided in our Field Manual. Take pictures and backup pictures or scans of the sample log each night after data collection.\n\n\n6.5.3 Connecting your sample log to a master laboratory sample log #todo\nBig idea - use Make (Integromat) to trigger a watch on a Survey123 survey that automatically appends row (note need to have survey set up with repeat to produce multiple records of samples with one survey record submission) to a master laboratory physical sample sheet. The Google sheet should also somehow provide a sample name for each? Or you could have in your question at the site or plot level with multipl entries - what are the names/IDs of the samples collected at this plot/site? YES, this second is the best way to go.\n\n\n6.5.4 Subsequent Laboratory Analysis of Physical Samples #todo\nThis should maybe be a separate chapter after lab analysis. then can be two stages - integrate with Google Sheets, pull from physical sample log, build on that."

NOTE: your Google Drive folders for your project should be configured exactly the same as your local PARA repository. Since you are using GitHub there doens’t need to be an extra full copy of the repo on Google Drive, so there will be a lot of empty folders - but that is fine. Set up a Google Sheet in your raw data folder for the project on Google Drive. Then, using the googlesheet4 package in R, [pull down a copy of the lab master sample log]#todo, [subset it for the samples in your project]#todo, and export that subset to another google sheet. Now you can add fields to the Google Sheet to populate them as you receive data or conduct laboratory analysis. *NOTE: once you have your project subsetted sample log you can create a field which contains an internal “lab” ID, which is usually a short integer and can be convenient when labelling tubes, etc. However, only include these short lab IDs on your project specific sample log. Do not include them on the laboratory master sample sheet.\nNOTE: if you are analyzing samples in your project that were not physically collected by you (but were collected by collaborators as part of this or another project), you should manually enter those samples into the master lab sample log and utilize the sample IDs provided by the collaborators.\n\n\n7.1.2 Self-Generated Data: Laboratory Notebook and Analysis or Task Log\nFor data that you are generating yourself, you should keep a [Laboratory Notebook] #todo - see standards and templates in our Laboratory Manual. If you are doing an analysis that results in manually recorded data (such as pH, which requires you to look at a screen and writ ethe number down in your lab notebook), data is then transferred manually from your laboratory notebook to the Google Sheet and fields are added as needed. If you are doing an analysis that results in digital data (such as pXRF, MIR, or LPSA), then you will need to export the digital data and populate it into the correct fields associated with the samples in your data sheet.\n\n\n7.1.3 Externally Generated Data: Original Data File + Integration\nFor externally generated data (i.e. you sent samples off to a commerical lab and recieved a pdf or tabular report back). you will need to export the digital data and populate it into the correct fields associated with the samples in your data sheet. NOTE that all original data files from external sources should be kept (as they were received) in a subfolder of the raw-data subdirectory."

    "text": "9.1 Pre-Data Infrastructure\n\n9.1.1 Selecting and documenting a data platform\nBecause data synthesis projects involve consolidating and wrangling of data from many different sources, it is important to choose a data “platform” that will support consolidation and curation of this data.\nThis data platform could be as simple as a well documented folder structure on your local computer, or more complex such as the UMN GEMS data platform, which provides a workspace for uploading datasets, curating dataset and field metadata, controlled vocabularies and ontologies, and post curation scripting for data harmonization.\nAll projects should include a data management plan (as a default you can use our template, developed from this workflow and located here #todo) however, data synthesis projects in particular require significant metadata documentation. As with other project types, this project-level metadata documentation should begin on project creation and continue during the pre-data phase, so that the documentation is well developed prior to data acquisition.\n\n\n9.1.2 Selecting and documenting data harmonization procedures\nData synthesis projects require some level of harmonization that allows comparison of similar data types between diverse datasets. At a high level, this harmonization requires understanding similar fields between different datasets, despite very different data structures and field naming conventions. It is important that this field data curation occurs in conjunction with field and dataset metadata in the original datasets.\nThere are two main approaches to data harmonization (may not be using the right terms here #todo):\n\nPre-ingestion harmonization\nPost-ingestion harmonization\n\nNOTE: see and cite the work of Kathe Todd-Brown and others here - include Hava’s expertise.\nThe advantages and disadvantages of each approach are as follows:\n\nPre-ingestion harmonization The advantage of pre-ingestion harmonization is that the datasets are manually placed in a single, easy to work with format. There are major disadvantages though. Fields are renamed from the original source with little to no record or mapping back to the original field in the original source.\nPost ingestion harmonization The advantage of post-ingestion harmonization is that raw datasets are retained on the data platform in their original form. Provided you have a data platform infrastructure that has advanced capabilities such as GEMS, field metadata tags can be added on top of the original field names in each dataset which both preserves the fidelity of the original data and provides mapping from terms and field names in the original data to a controlled vocabulary or ontology developed and documented in the context of the project."

Malcom Barrett gave an an excellent talk at the useR! 2020 conference entitled “Why use the here package when you’re already using projects?”. The .Rproj file contained in this tenplate is pre-configured to start with a completely clean workspace EVERY TIME by selecting in Project Options > General “Restore .RData into workspace at startup” = NO and “Save workspace to .RData on exit” = NO, “Disable .Pprofile execution on session start/resume” = CHECKED, “Quit child processes on exit” = CHECKED. These two options combined will also ensure that others running your code (or even you at a later date) don’t experience errors or conflictions due to workspace-specific background - this is often the cause of the following issue: “I swear…my code worked the last time I ran it and I didn’t change anything!”.

In a .csv file, commas separate cells within a row and returns (new lines) indicate a new row. Tabular data in text form with other delimiters (such as tab, space or custom delimiters) can be converted to .csv formats easily in R.\nNote that one disadvantage of .csv formats is that data types which are stored in databases (such as dataframes in R or in other databases) are not retained. The data is text only. For most projects this is not an issue since R will automatically detect data types upon ingestion, but for some specialized projects database to database transfers might be better a better option to retain this information if necessary.\n\n\n11.1.2 Spatial data\nVector data (points, lines and polygons) should be converted to OGC Geopackage format. This can be easily accomplished in the terra package in R.\nRaster data (cell-based information) should be converted to GeoTIFF format.\nNote that these conversions can also occur as part of larger scripts in workflows, but should be documented clearly.\n\n\n11.1.3 Images\nImages should be converted to .jpeg format without compression so that the original image quality is retained. If you are taking pictures on an iPhone, the raw exported format will be Apple’s proprietary .HEIC format which is readable on Apple devices but not Windows devices. .jpeg is currently the most widely used and future proof image format. #todo - add something about RAW formats from DSLRs.\nThese conversions need to occur with a manual workflow using a Native application such as Preview or a proprietary application such as Photoshop.\n\n\n11.1.4 Videos\n#todo - .mpeg format?"

    "text": "12.1 Naming things\nNaming things is hard - one of the hardest parts of scripting. Below are the guidelines you should use for naming things in your R code as a memebr of my lab group. These are not absolute rules, but rather guidelines that will ensure all of our code is consistent and is readable by all group members. Here are some general guidelines before I get to the specific styles below. These guidelines are from Robert Martin’s Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship (2009)\n\nDon’t use names of established objects, classes or functions\nMake Meaningful Distinctions\nAvoid Redundancy\nUse pronounceable names\nUse searchable names\nDon’t be cute\nPick one word for an abstract concept and stick to it - i.e. don’t use synonyms - instead add a description in the name after that word; i.e. “get_type”, “get_value”, etc.\nDon’t add gratuitous context or prefixes\n\n\n12.1.1 R scripts\nThese files end in .R. They should contain NO special characters !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ) or spaces. Only lowercase letters (no capital letters), -, and _. Additionally, I highly recommend adding numbers to your R scripts within projects (see section X.X, above. This helps both with file name recall and for you and/or a user to understand a sequence for running the scripts (if there is one). Left pad the numbers with a zero to allow you to go up to 99. The “00” script should be reserved for a master script that runs all of the other scripts for a project within it. The name for your script should be descriptive, and preferably 2-4 words in length. However if a longer name provides a better description or more comprehensive readability do not hesitate to use it!\n# Good\n00_master_script.R\n01_load_baseline_data.R\n\n# Bad \n00 Master!.R\n01LOAD.R\n\n\n12.1.2 Functions\nFor functions that you write (i.e. private functions), use .BigCamelCase. The camel case clearly differentiates functions from other named things (objects and scripts), and the dot at the beginning clearly identifies the function as a private function, and not one being called from Base R or an existing package.\n# Good\n.DoNothingPrivately <- function() {\n  return(invisible(NULL))\n}\n\n# Bad\ndo_nothing <- function() {\n  return(invisible(NULL))\n}\nR.C. Martin (2009) suggests the following with regard to writing functions. Many of these are useful, some irrelevant in 2023, but all good things to think about if you are writing your own functions: - Functions should be small, less than 20 lines max, and even smaller than that if possible. - Blocks and indenting should be used - Functions should do one thing - “if a function does only the step that are one level of abstraction below the stated name of the function, then the function does one thing”. - another way “to know that a function is doing more than one thing is if you can extract another function from it with a name that is not merely a restatement of its implementation” - One level of abstraction per function - what is a “level of abstraction”? - the stepdown rule - read code from top to bottom - human readable: to blank then we need to blank, to blank then we need to blank, etc - see page 113 - Use Descriptive Names - Try to have two arguments per function max\n\n\n12.1.3 Objects\nObject names are assigned within an R script. Similar to script names, they should contain NO special characters !, @, #, $, %, ^, &, *, (, ) or spaces. Only lowercase letters (no capital letters), -, and _. Unlike script names, however, they do not begin with numbers. The name for your objects should be descriptive, and preferrably 2-4 words in length. However if a longer object name provides a better description or more comprehensive readability you may use it! Just be aware there is a dichotomy here - unlike script names, objects tend to be called and referred to multiple times and therefore will show up in your code multiple times. Long and/or tedious object names can be difficult to maintain. So think carefully about these. I think naming objects is the hardest. also, name linear models with a .lm at the end etc. Plots )or saved plot components end in .p\n# Good\npf_binary\nannual_data\n\n# Bad \nPFbinary\nannual data"
