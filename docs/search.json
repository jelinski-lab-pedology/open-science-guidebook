    "text": "This book outlines an open, standardize workflow for use on all projects in the Jelinski lab. With the diverse library of tools, apps, and digital repositories available to you as it as a researcher, it is extremely difficult to understand which ones to use and how to put together a workflow. My goal is to standardize workflow for all projects in our lab - or at the very least to provide a scaffold, foundational approach that everyone can borrow and modify from as best fits their needs. This is not so much meant to force you into a particular way of doing your thinking things, but rather to free you up to do what’s really important, the research. Making decisions about how to name files, what format and style to use for code, how to structure project files and folders, and what tools and apps to use is exhausting, and these decisions take you away from the science. The goal of this standardized workflow is to produce transparent, open science, that is easily reproducible, transparent, usable by others, and most importantly well organized and documented so that you and others can easily understand what you’ve done and how you’ve done it. There are a few principal concepts behind this workflow and how you can structure your work to be most productive:\n\n\nA major part of research is hitting dead ends, going down rabbit holes, and generally feeling like you might be wasting your time because it’s taking you so long two get to the correct analysis or perspective. However, none of this is waste of time. Every dead end is a door that has closed to allow you to find your path forward. It’s your job as a scientist and researcher to define and document those dead ass and not give up. Recognize that those that ends are part of the process, and make those dead ends work for you. By using a standardized workflow even those dead ends become reproducible transparent learning experiences that are documented fully for you and others to grow from.\n\n\n\nOne of my mentors as probationary faculty, Dr. Ed Nater, told me that a career in science “is a marathon, not a sprint”. Despite the modern urgency to publish as many papers as possible in a short amount of time, research still takes time. And often we don’t know exactly how long is gonna take. It’s better to do good science then to do fast science. Of course ideally we could do good, fast science. This workflow will help you do that - it will help you do good science, create transparent citeable and reproducible content, even from your unfinished drafts, dead ends, and false starts. Because research is not is a marathon and not a sprint, it is absolutely important that you take care of your whole being. This means taking care of your body and your mind. Let me tell you a story.\nAs an academic, most of us who are in this for the career work long hours. I’ve been working long hours overnights, 50 to 60 hours a week for as long as I can remember - this is normal in academia. I used to view this as “the grind”. I used to think that the answer to be more productive was just putting in more hours in the grind. If I could just stay up one more night, push through for three more hours, sit at my desk for 10-12 hours in a day, and work work work, I could produce more. What I realized as I’ve reached the middle of my career is that there are more ways to produce more which also allow you to be healthier than just grinding the large number of hours. Certainly hours are important, for example you probably are not gonna publish a research paper write a thesis write a dissertation or be successful in a faculty job without putting in more than 40 hours a week and some overnights. But, those should not be the norm. There are ways to design your life so that those are few and far between. Striving for a physical and mental balance is extremely important and my years of grinding have taken a toll. Although they have given me a lot, and I’ve been able to achieve tenure, looking back I now see how I could have changed my processes to work fewer hours, be more physically healthy and more mentally available for my friends and family, and produce more.\nMuch of this starts with prioritizing your physical health. You simply can’t reach your top productivity if you are not physically healthy because the mind-body connection is strong. Physical health is a cornerstone for long-term productivity in any career. And science is no different. After years of mucking through different processes, workflows, and trial and error, I’m finally starting to reach an understanding regarding how to construct these processes to reduce decision fatigue and be more productive, allow me more time to do more things outside of work and to take care of myself my family. This all involves standardization. Jocko Willink is famous for his mantra “Discipline Equals Freedom”. This mantra also holds true in creative work such as academia. Although it seems counterintuitive and potentially restricting at first, standardized processes actually allow you to do better, more creative, more reproducible, and more inspiring work. Note to insert references to dance, art and writers that have used standardized processes. This is because all of the small decisions that you make about, for example (just to name a few):\n\nWhat to name files how to create a structure in a folder,\nwhat app to use to do data analysis,\nhow to write and structure code,\n\nreduce your ability to focus on what really matters, generating data, analyzing data, the science and the writing. By standardizing workflows and processes, we relegate the trivial stuff to a trusted system This system is one that holds important information, and allows you to access it freely and readily, but makes all of the trivial decisions for you. This allows you to focus on just the information. It frees you to think more and more deeply about what really matters, to focus your time and effort outside of work on your physical and mental health.\n\n\n\n10 years ago, very few people were doing open science. Now with openscapes and a handful of other strong initiatives more and more people are doing open science in environmental fields. More journals require that you submit raw data, code or somehow package everything to make your analysis and results reproducible. This workflow will allow you to do that automatically as you build your project. When you get to the point of submitting a manuscript you will already have a citable online repository that you can point to when you submit your manuscript. This workflow also fosters a mindset of development and growth, where you “show your work” all the time. Showing your work all the time is a great way to:\n\nFoster collaboration,\nto be “constantly producing”, and\n\nto feel more accomplished feel that you can be “done” at the end of a workday day.\n\nIn the beginning you may find implementing this workflow to be slower, and at first there will be a learning curve. Also, fitting your project into a standardize workflow will cause you to work a bit slower at sometimes then you could if you didn’t have to fit in the standardize workflow. However after 18 years of managing projects and doing science, I can tell you the time effort and mental strain saved from having an organized, standardized, and open process and workflow will save you an incredible amount of time, but it can also provide you a strong foundation that you can carry into the future and never duplicate or backtrack on work you have already done. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gone back to read a paper that I’ve read five times just to fit it into another reference, or to format a bibliography, or to make sense of code that I wrote just six months ago, or to update the class syllabus documents or find different versions of files that are scattered across my computer, in cloud storage, and named different things. As you go on your research career you will accumulate more and more of this baggage. If you start with a standardized workflow early in your career, this baggage will be manageable, well structured, available to you and others, and will actually promote a positive feedback loop whereby the work that you do now makes future work even easier.\n\n\n\nI am a traveler on this road as well. I do not have all of the answers, but I have spent time developing a system and set of tools that have begun to pay huge dividends in my work and personal life. I hope to share these lessons learned with you.\nI hope you will join me on this journey."

The PARA system (Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive) is an excellent place to start for organizing your files - if you don’t have strong feelings about how your work files are organized on your computer, I highly suggest starting with this. If you do have strong feelings, you can always adapt the system to something that works for you. Utilizing this system doesn’t necessarily commit you to going back and re-organizing all of your work files on your computer. Just start now, and build as you go and work on new projects. As you have time in the future, you can always go back and fit your previous work into this structure. However - see my notes on things to watch for when you go back to “refactor” your files and folder structure.\nThe most important thing is to start now; start today.\nThe second most important thing is to use the same structure across apps, platforms, and languages, which will allow deep integration and ensure you always know where everything is. You will spend less time trying to find for example, a small test R script you wrote last year or that interesting thing you read 18 months (or 2 months!) ago that was related to this project."

    "text": "1.1 The PARA system in practice\nTiago Forte’s PARA acronym stands for: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive. This system is not strictly hierarchical, but each category from front to back in PARA is given precedence over the last. That is because the underlying philosophy is that projects should produce end outputs or deliverables. Things that are not yet projects, or are larger than a single project are more nebulous, but not any less valuable.\nUsing the PARA system requires you to set up high level folders (I would suggest in the Documents directory of your computer) for each of the PARA categories: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archive. Then, all of your professional work, and eventually some of your personal work and interests will nest under these.\nDeciding what is a “Project” vs an “Area” vs a “Resource” vs an “Archive” is probably the most important part of this workflow and drives everything else, so I will start there. One simple way to think about this is that when you need to consider where something should go in this system start at the beginning - if its doesn’t fit into the definition of a “Project”, then move down and see if it fits into the definition of an “Area”. If it is not an “Area”, then it will likely be a “Resource” unless it is something completed or inactive, in which case it goes in the “Archive”."

How should I name my Projects?\n\n1.2.1 Defining Projects - How to Determine if Something is a Project\nThis seems like a trivial question but defining project boundaries in research can be difficult. Where does one project end and another begin? Does a project include multiple sub projects?\nA project is something you are involved in that has a discrete, definable end state or product. Note that our definition of projects here means they are flat. There should not be multiple projects nested under other projects. Each project is a discrete entity - this alings with GitHub repository organization (as we will see in future chapters), which allows deep integration. In our line of work, examples would be:\n\nA thesis chapter; see below for why a thesis or dissertation itself is actually larger than a Project - it is an Area\nA manuscript\nA grant might be a project, but is usually better defined as an Area (because these days all grants are collaborative) with multiple projects underneath. Also, because most grants actually have multiple end products such as reports and manuscripts.\nReports to stakeholders on unpublished data.\nX Are conference presentations nested in here? No - they are not projects but nested under projects.\nX Photos are nested and linked to projects in the GitHub readme file\n\n\n\n1.2.2 Naming Projects\nThis is a general style guide for naming projects (in the context of files or folder structures). Projects may have very long actual names (or you may not even know what, exactly the name of your project or project idea will eventually be). This doesn’t matter for the purposes of project setup. For now, we just need a two to three word abbreviated title for the project that we will use in our folder structure. For example, I am working on a manuscript called “Techniques for Field Identification of the Permafrost Table” - but the three words in the project name in my folder structure are: permafrost, table, ID. Here is a style guide for naming your projects:\n\nUse all lowercase letters and short dashes instead of spaces.\nProjects should be designated as M (for manuscript, including thesis chapters, which should each be a publishable unit), P (for proposal), or C (for communications such as reports) depending on the type of the end output.\nProjects should be given a two digit number (with a leading zero for any project numbers under 10) - these are just given in sequence as you create projects - so your first project is 01 - the order doesn’t matter.\nProjects should have a unique two to three word abbreviated name that is different from other projects you are working on.\n\nYour final project name is a combination of these three components as follows. Lets say I wanted to create a project structure for the “Techniques for Field Identification of the Permafrost Table” manuscript I am working on, and lets say it is the 9th project in my directory.\nMy project name is then TypeNumber-Word1-Word2-Word3. So, the project name for my manuscript would be:\nM09-permafrost-table-ID"

Some of these folders may remain empty for the duration of your project and that is just fine! Note that each of the folders have a number convention for quick association once you start using this standardized structure. The numbers also allow for the folders to be arranged in a logical order, rather than alphabetically.\n\n2.2.1 /00-data-raw\nThis folder contains your curated raw data: unmodified, comprehensive, containing outliers, missing values, imperfections and other items that may be removed in data pre-processing. Insert link to data pre-processing chapter. It also contains any foundational geospatial data from other authors/sources that you did not generate but that you are pulling in for the purposes of analysis and that needs further processing to be utilized in your workflow. For example if an external data source came in a proprietary format that needed to be exported and modified. Note - need to create a subfolder separate for this, and also need to have a way to track origin and authorship - probably a readme or metadata file .txt or something - can be a running open file that is added to - maybe a markdown or something?\nAny raw data that you generated should be in open and easily readable formats. Specifically:\n\nTabular data should be in .csv format\nSpatial vector data (points, lines or polygons) should be in OGC geopackage format.\n\nAny data in raw data that is not your own should be in an /external-sources subdirectory which contains a metadata file that details the source of each of the external data sources.\n\n\n2.2.2 /01-data\nThis folder is the sink where all of your post-processed data will live. It also contains any foundational geospatial data from other authors/sources that you did not generate but that you are pulling in for the purposes of analysis following any necessary processing to change formats - note that this can include reprojected data, etc? actually maybye it shouldn’t because all of that can go into an R script - hmm need to think about this. Note - need to create a subfolder separate for this, and also need to have a way to track origin and authorship - probably a readme or metadata file .txt or something - can be a running open file that is added to - maybe a markdown or something? Data should be in open and easily readable formats. Specifically:\n\nTabular data should be in .csv format\nSpatial vector data (points, lines or polygons) should be in OGC geopackage format.\nSpatial raster data should be in GeoTIFF format.\n\nAny data in that is not your own should be in an /external-sources subdirectory which contains a metadata file that details the source of each of the external data sources.\n\n\n2.2.3 /02-src\nThis folder contains all of your source code and R scripts that you use to conduct your data processing and analysis. Note link to how to actually write and breakdown and organize scripts and analysis in projects - this can be in your R style guide or as a separate section - talk about sequential numbering, a master script, functions script, global script, readme, and how to renumber or keep your growing scripts squared away. This folder should always contain a .Rproj file to initialize the environment for running your R scripts.\n\n\n2.2.4 /03-cache\nYour cache folder may not be used often. However it is there to provide a storage place for any large objects or data that take a very long time to generate initially in a script. When these are generated once, they can be exported to this folder - this provides a shortcut for subsequent running of the scripts that saves time. People can still run your original scripts to generate these objects if they so choose.\n\n\n2.2.5 /04-temp\nThe temp folder is basically to hold any temporary non-important files, such as tests script outputs, test figures, etc. These are not important to the overall analysis. This folder should be empty and not be included in your final project using [.gitignore] file.\n\n\n2.2.6 /05-manuscript\nThis folder houses everything related to manuscripts or reports resulting from the project. It has subfolders for holding drafts, submitted versions (inclduign subsequent revisions), final and proofs, figures, tables, and references (which contains a single .bib file - ideally exported from your Zotero project folder which matches the name of this project).\n\n\n2.2.7 /06-presentations\nThis folder should contain subfolders for each presentation realted to the topic. Subfolders should start with “P0X” and also include the year and venue. So if I gave a presentation at the Soil Science Sciety of America meetings in 2017 on a particular project, and it was the first presentation that I gave under that project, my subdirectory containing all of the relevant things for that presentation would be “P01-2017-SSSA”.\n\n\n2.2.8 /07-log\nThis folder contains logs related to your project, specifically your analysis log and writing log. You can choose to make these public or not. See this section for how to write and construct logs - do it at the end of every day/session - take the 5 MINUTES!!!\n\n\n2.2.9 /08-archive\nThis folder contains anything that is not relevant to the current workflow but that you are not ready to delete permanently yet. Items can be moved to the archive folder at any time.\n\n\n2.2.10 /docs\nIf you choose to create a book to consolidate your metadata and readmes, all relevant files should go in this subdirectory. More information on generating an html book from separate markdown files here. NOTE - the only way to get GitHub Pages to find the files and render the htmls together is to have them in a /docs subdirectory. There is no other options currently. That is why /docs doesn’t have a number before it.\n\n\n2.2.11 readme.txt\nThis is arguably one of the most important features of your entire project. The readme should always be in plain text .txt format so that anyone on any system can read it. Spending time on your readme file is extremely important:\n\nIt is the first writing you will do on your project and helps you to describe at a high level what your project is about\nIt is the file that tells everyone the who, what, when where, why, and how of this project:\n\nwho created this project?\nwhat is in this project?\nwhen was it created?\nwhere can i find relevant data, files, and documents within the project structure?\nwhy was this project done; what was the motivation?\nhow should I use these project files; what are the file formats, what programs do I need to run or access them; how were these files created and using what tools?\n\n\nA readme is a living document. You should begin any project with a draft readme, which, provided you use this workflow and file structure can be mostly copied from a suggested template located in this section. However, as your project grows and changes, your readme should be updated. Be as thorough as possible. Note that this is a project level readme. Although not required, you should strongly consider including sub readmes at within multipl subfolders where necessary. Conversely, you can create a project level book in Quarto that contains all readmes and documentation (see section X). More information on how to use and write a readme in section X.\n\n\n2.2.12 TODOs.txt\nThis is a running list of TODOs - actually this shouldn’t be a thing. You should use GitHub Issues to track this? Not sure need to look into this more."

    "text": "4.2 What is the difference between github.com and github.umn.edu and where should my project go?\nFirst and most importantly, the University Enterprise version of GitHub github.umn.edu is a private instance of GitHub that is accessible only to students, faculty and staff (i.e. you must have a UMN x500 number to access it). Apart from the standard GitHub interface, look and feel, it is on completely different servers and does not talk to public GitHub. If you no longer have an x500, you will not be able to access UMN Enterprise GitHub. Because you may not be at the University of Minnesota for your entire career, you should generally default to setting up and using your personal profile on public GitHub, which you will be able to maintain and access in perpetuity. However, there are some limited instances when the UMN Enterprise version of GitHub might be preferred:\n\nYou want to create a repository that is only accessible to UMN students, faculty and staff.\nYou want to publish a Quarto book using GitHub Pages for a class, but only want students who are in the class at UMN to be able to see and access it. NOTE: generally speaking, I am of the philosophy that most general class materials such as the syllabus, lab manuals, and other exercises should be public, however there are some class items such as student submissions and essays that you would not want to be public. However for most classes, the use for GitHub would just be to publish a stable link to a Quarto book using GitHub Pages and point to it in your Canvas course site, since Canvas is the platform of choice for classes. Everything else regarding class management can and should be done in Canvas with the exception of some computer science classes that are writing and submitting code on GitHub as a matter of professional practice. UMN Enterprise GitHub instance makes a lot of sense for those classes but not for many others.\nYou want to “show your work as you go” on a project in this workflow, by utilizing a project book (modeled on Hava’s procedure), but do not want others to see this until you are ready to share it. On github.umn.edu, you can create a private repository and publish a Quarto rendered book using GitHub pages that only you will be able to see or that you will be able to tighly control access on. NOTE: On public GitHub, you have the ability to set repo access to private. However, when using the free tier of GitHub, you cannot publish a Quarto book to GitHub Pages unless your repo is public. Therefore, in order to keep a repo private and keep a book-based project and analysis log, everyone will be able to see your progress. Maybe this is ok, maybe it isn’t it is up to you and the nature of your project. Conversely - the “Team” tier for GitHub is (as of 2022) $44/yr, and allows you to publish private GitHub pages from private repos where you control access.\n\nBottom line: if you are a graduate student working on a project as part of your thesis, you can initiate your repo on UMN Enterprise GitHub if you choose (that way you won’t have to worry about privacy and can publish to GitHub Pages without paying). Especially for your first repo and when you are learning to use GitHub, this will also allow you to experiment with Git functionality without fear of public access in any way, shape, or form. However, just be aware then when your project moves to final stages you will need to create a new repository on your public GitHub and push from the repo on your local computer - you cannot simply mirror your UMN Enterprise repo to public GitHub. Not a big deal either way, but you should plan ahead for what is most appropriate for your project."

I highly recommend when you are just starting to learn how to use GitHub, and even beyond. There are other options for interacting with GitHub and GitHub repos - such as command line tools and through R Studio, but until you know the basics and understand what is happening and when, using command line tools will likely be more confusing. Once you know what you are doing, it can sometimes be more convenient to interact with your repos through R Studio (seldom is the command line more convenient), but its really not that much more convenient. Bottom line: Set up and use GitHub Desktop unless you have a compelling reason not to!"

Especially if a project is also a GitHub repo, at the very least it encourages you to write some metadata, and have a file structure for when things do come up. Also, the project feels more official and branded, which can sometimes be a kick in the pants to get moving, esp if public.\nHow to decide when to make a repo on GitHub - some options:\n\nAnytime!\nOnce you have some materials in your project folder\nOnce the project is well defined\n\nit’s common for dissertation chapters and non-data (i.e. review or big idea manuscripts (what I will call luxury manuscripts) to be nebulous and change). These are usually not very collaborative either. You can wait to make GitHub repos for these until they coalesce or become better defined.

The default license for projects in our lab is X #todo\n\n\n\n4.7.2 Jelinski Lab GitHub Workflow Follows GitHub Flow\nOur standard GitHub workflow follows the well documented GitHub flow process, which is a branch based workflow:\n\nIf you are the sole person working on a repository, you can get away with pushing and pulling from the /main branch.\nHowever, if you are working on your repository with others (or even by yourself, but want to ensure you don’t inadvertently change your main branch while making edits and changes), you should create a branch within the repo and give it a descriptive name. You can modify, push and pull from the branch, and allow others to see what you have done.\nEventually, once you are happy with your changes (if you wish) merge it with the main branch to update everything. GitHub has some excellent tools for merging and for controlling through “pull request merges](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request).\nAfter a branch has been fully merged, it can be deleted and pruned without loss of information as deleting a branch does not delete the commit history.\n\n\n\n4.7.3 Guidelines for Pushing to Your Repo\nAdditionally, you should do the following when working with your GitHub repo:\n\nStrive to commit and push to your repo at the end of each day of work on a project or at small milestones in your work. Writing good commit messages (see below) will help you understand when to do that. Don’t wait long periods of time to push your local repo/directory to your GitHub repo! This is incremental work!\nEvery commit should contain a good commit message, and a detailed description where possible. General guidelines that we will follow whihc are adapted from Robert Painsi, (Bolaji Ayodeji, including example from Tim Pope Toni Bardina and GitKraken:\n\nCommit messages should have an entry in the subject and body\nSubject line should be capitalized and less than 50 characters\nSpaces are allowed\nNo period at end of subject line, punctuations allowed in body of message (description on GitHub Desktop)\nSubject line written in imperative mode (i.e. Add, not Added or Adds)\nSubject line should begin with one of the following verbs (which are adapted from their comp sci meanings to what best fits our work - see full list here):\n\nAdd - added a document, file, code, or section within a document\nDelete - added a document, file, code, or section within a document\nEdit - edited a document, file, code, or section within a document\nFix - fix an issue e.g. bug, typo, accident, misstatement.\nStart - begin doing something\nStop - end doing something\nRefactor - reorganize or refactor code\nRestructure - reorganize or refactor directory or project structure\nDocument - editing, changing or adding to metadata\n\n\nThe commit message body should only contain what and never why or how. Whys and hows should go into documentation such as project logs (writing or analysis logs), metadata, or the project Quarto book (if you have one)."

You should then set up a folder (i.e. subcollection) under the 00-projects folder that is named the same as your project directory or repo name (i.e. “M09-permafrost-table-id”).

This deep integration makes it easy to cache and later find all of the references that you come across prior to the point where you are spending time on dedicated wirting on your manuscript. This allows you to begin building a bibliography before you even begin writing your manuscript in earnest. If you are searching for references online or come across a reference online, simply:\n\nMake sure Zotero is open\nEnsure your “000 Inbox” folder is highlighted\nClick the Zotero add-on icon in your browser to import the full paper reference (note: this also works for websites and books).\nIf you have access to the pdf (i.e. if it is open sources or if you are logged in to University internet or remotely through VPN to the University Libraries), the pdf will also be automatically downloaded and attached to your reference record.\n\n*NOTE: I prefer to send everything to the Inbox first and then later go through the inbox to shuffle records to the relevant folders. However, if you choose you could also highlight the relevant folder instead of 000 Inbox and Zotero will send the reference there instead of to your inbox. Note that Zotero allows you to place a single reference in two or more collections or subcollections without duplication of the original file. This is very handy. There are many other excellent Zotero features - not least of which is [Integration with Obsidian]#todo, merging duplicate references, text and area highlighting in PDFs, and sharing reference collections."

Data is the information that drives a project and is used for answering a problem, question, or achieving a result.\nRaw data is data in its original form - unfiltered, unprocessed, with potential errors, outliers, and duplicates. Without “pre-data” infrastructure, there is no structured repository for raw data. The quality of your pre-data infrastructure depends on how well you have thought through your project and what types of information will be generated through the course of data collection.\nExamples of pre-data infrastructure are:\n\nA digital form for collecting information about samples or sampling sites\nA hard copy data sheet for recording information about soil samples or soil morphology in the field\nAn image repository or image organizing system (such as the native “Photos” app on iOS)\nLaboratory notebooks or spreadsheets for recording data generated in the lab\nLiterature review protocols\nLiterature review tools or apps\nData platforms such as GEMS"

    "text": "6.1 Pre-Data Infrastructure\n\n6.1.1 Survey123 for tabular data, spatial data, and image collection\nOur standardized tool for data collection for field projects is ArcGIS Survey123. Survey123 is a tool that allows you to create customized data entry and submission forms that you can then access through the Survey123 app on your phone. These forms can be created through the ArcGIS Online Survey123 portal. Although it is a proprietary tool, all faculty, students and staff at UMN have full, free access to the ArcGIS Online suite of tools which includes Survey123. Despite the fact that Survey123 is proprietary and not open source, it is highly functional and therefore the ease of use makes it our tool of choice. This chapter assumes you are familiar and have accessed Survey123. If you have not worked with Survey123 before, it is well supported and documented by ESRI and you can check out our Tools: Survey123 chapter #todo in this book.\n\n\n6.1.2 Lab Standards for Survey123 Form\nAs you set up your Survey123 form, you should think through each of the pieces of information that will be important to collect in the field and provide a way to capture that information in your form. When in doubt - err on the side of including it in your form - you can always ignore it in the field while using the app if there is some redundancy.\nIf you are doing a field project, you should strongly consider using Survey123 to collect your plot or site-level data. Think of what unit of your sampling will have a unqiue latitude and longitude and that is the data collection unit that your survey form should be designed for. For example, if you have a project that requires taking soil cores, with multiple samples from different depths taken from each core, then the survey form should be designed around each of the cores, which will have a unqiue latitude and longitude, and not each of the samples (many of which from the same core will have the same latitude and longitude).\nSurvey123 excels at consolidating spatial data (latitudes and longitudes), tabular data (text, numbers, or X entered in response to questions on the form), and images (taken in response to questions on the form) in one location. When you submit each of your records, this raw data will live in the Survey123 database through ArcGIS Online that is associated with your form.\nOur laboratory standards for Survey123 forms is that they should (at a minimum) collect the following information:\n\nName of initials of person recording data or submitting record\nGPS location of record (autocollected in response to location question)\nDate and time of record collection (autocollected in response to time question)\nUnique plot or observation number in the context of the project\n\nYour Survey123 form should also include fields to enter all relevant raw data as required by your project.\n\n\n6.1.3 Additional Survey123 Functionality of Interest\nImages. Survey123 is an excellent way to collect and organize images. Single image submission questions can be configured to collect multiple images. Once submitted, all images are stored with the associated record in the online database.\nDeep Customization - XLSForms Deeper functionality for setting up forms in Survey123 requires a PC and the use of XLSForms and Survey123 Conect (a desktop app that only runs on Windows). While this is very annoying for us Mac users, it allows extensive customization of your Survey123 form, including but certainly not limited to:\n\nRepeats: “Repeats” allow you to generate multiple records (rows) from a single survey entry/submission - so for example, you can generate multiple rows for the master sample log (each row is a sample) from one submission form (plot or pedon): https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-survey123-blog/survey123-tricks-of-the-trade-repeats/ba-p/898041\nCustomizing File Names for Submitted Images: Customaization through XLS Forms allows you to set the file names of submitted photos - this is really important - automatically annotate photo file names with project, plot, and question or anything else from designated fields in the form (as well as date/time). This functionality can save significant time when you go to curate your photo archive. https://community.esri.com/t5/arcgis-survey123-blog/survey123-tricks-of-the-trade-set-the-file-name-of/ba-p/1217125\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Hard Copy Field Data Sheets\nSurvey123 is an excellent tool for collecting plot or site level data in the field with your phone. However, some types of field data collection are extremely difficult to digitize under field conditions. Examples of these are:\n\nSoil morphology data (lots of specialized acronyms, notes, and chicken scratches add depth to the data, often difficult to use phone while textureing soil, many fields and extremely time consuming to use an app or tablet in the field).\nData consisting of many numbers or that exists at the sample level. Remember I said that Survey123 really shines when used at the level of unique geospatial coordinates which is typically the plot or site level. However, often times we may also be collecting data at the sample level. For example recording the dimensions of a permafrost soil core section that will go into a sample bag, or the field pH and EC of a soil sample. These data are best collected using hard copy forms. There are examples of hard copy forms for field data collection that Megan Andersen put together in the Jelinski Lab Field Handbook repository [here]#todo. Always print your hard copy forms on Rite-In-The-Rain!!"
